      <h1>The Importance of Cyber Security</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">With all of the added benefits of becoming an increasingly connected modern world, precautions must be taken to allow for some of the most vulnerable in our community to be protected - the elderly. </h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">For a variety of reasons which include a lack of familiarity with the online world, many elderly find themselves at risk of being exploited online. The main way in which to combat this threat is to education on some basic rules of saftey while being online. This is the purpose of this site, as the information relating to this can be found below.</p>

      <h1>The Difference between HTTP and HTTPS</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, while HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">One of the most basic rules while browsing online is sticking to pages which use HTTPS, this information can be found in the address bar infront of the sites domain name. A site which uses HTTPS would normally look like this https://en-gb.facebook.com. The reason this is as HTTPS uses a secure connection so any information exhanged over the site may be stolen by an attacker.</p>

      <h1>Identifying Phising Emails</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Phishing is a term used to describe a malicious individual or group of individuals who scam users. They do so by sending e-mails or creating web pages that are designed to collect an individual's online bank, credit card, or other login information.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">There are various techniques used to identify phising emails, one of the most basic is to check for spelling mistakes, or generic messages such as "Dear Customer". Another technique is to always check the email address rather than the display name to check if the address sent was from a fraudulent source. Finally, a company will ask for personal details over email so do not send personal details end if asked.</p>

      <h1>Identifying Fraudulent Websites</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">It can be difficult to spot a fake, fraudulent or scam website. Fraudsters are extremely cunning and good at creating convincing websites.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Some simple ways in order to identify these sites are to always check the domain name as while many will try to have references to well known brands, there will be slight differences in order to trick users. Also be careful of sites which end .net or .org when using them to purchase products. Often the best way to check these sites is to browse through them to check for anything which may draw suspicion. Check for such things as an about page which may have spelling errors or phrases which do not sound right. Another way in order to be sure is check online reviews; however if there are multiple reviews all sounding very generic these too can be faked. Finally, a very good indication to the trustworthiness​ of a site is to check for a padlock next the websites URL as this means the site is encrypted so payments cannot be intercepted.</p>

      <h1>Creating and Handling Passwords</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Passwords may seem like an annoyance blocking you from what you want to do online, but of course they help keep your personal information safe from hackers who may use the information against you.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">When creating your password there are some various techniques which vastly improve your secuirty. While most sites correctly make sure the password is of a certain length, and have various punctuation characters the main issue arrises for havinf multiple accounts with the same password, and having these passwords containing specific information regarding the user such as a birthday.This can lead to an attacker gathering access to multiple accounts very quickly. Now, while it may be hard to remember these passwords this is where a password manager may be useful. A password manager randomly generates a password and securely stores these passwords for a user. A password manager which is very useful is 1password, and information on this can be found at the following address: https://1password.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIid3UyPKE6QIVU-3tCh2rbQHQEAAYASAAEgIu4_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds </p>

      <h1>Updating a device</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">While updating your device is important for many reasons, the main however is it allows for various security vulnerabilities to be fixed. Companies are constantly finding issues with their software and these updates are important in stopping hackers gaining access to your device.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">While updates may seem annoying they are vitally important, and it should also be noted that not updating may be endagering your other people. If a device is compromised then personal information on not only yourself will become avilable to hackers, but also information on your family and friends if it is contained on the device. A very good recomendation is to make sure notications are constantly turned on for updates as this will constantly notfiy users as soon as these updates become available. This process can also be automated so that a time does not have to be scheuled for the update.</p>
